# Hands-on-Eloquent-JavaScript-
My modest solutions to the exercises in "Eloquent JavaScript" (4th ed.)

I am currently learning JS. In this repo I am putting notes I took when reading the book and experimenting, as long as solutions to the exercises. These concise notes are presented linearily, just as I'd like to read them if I had to interrupt my apprenticeship and resume it much later. 

Some of the notes and solutions reflect questions I've asked myself, exploring concepts that go beyond the book's themes. Also, I'm not trying to write the “best” solutions or apply a consistent style throughout the tutorial. I try to keep a good balance between performance and clarity of the ideas expressed.
