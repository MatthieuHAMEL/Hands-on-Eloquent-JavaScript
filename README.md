# Hands-on-Eloquent-JavaScript
My modest solutions to the exercises in "Eloquent JavaScript" (4th ed.)

**NB**

I am currently learning JS. For each chapter I present the notes I took when reading the book and experimenting, as long as solutions to the exercises. These notes are meant to be concise and linear, just as I'd like to read them if I had to interrupt my apprenticeship and resume it much later. I don't say everything, I only note the things that are not natural to me and my traditional Java/C++ background.

Some of the notes and solutions reflect questions I've asked myself, exploring concepts that go beyond the book's themes. Also, I'm not trying to write the “best” solutions or apply a consistent style throughout the tutorial. I try to keep a good balance between performance and clarity of the ideas expressed.
